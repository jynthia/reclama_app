		<h2 id="life">Early Life and Education</h2>

		<p> Ada Lovelace was born in London, England on December 10, 1815. She was named Augusta Ada Byron, but her surname changed after she married.Her father was the brilliant, yet notorious poet Lord Byron (mad, bad and dangerous to know!) and her mother was Anne Isabella Milbanke. Her father was one of the greats of poetry, but his personality was unstable. Her mother was highly intelligent, had been well-educated by private tutors, and was particularly enthusiastic about mathematics and the sciences.Ada's father abandoned his wife and daughter, leaving Britain forever when Ada was one month old. He died in Greece when Ada was eight years old. Ada never knew him.</p>

		<p> Ada's mother, Lady Byron, seems to have had little or no affection for her daughter and had very little contact with her. The young girl was brought up by her maternal grandmother and servants. Her grandmother died when Ada was just seven years old, and Ada herself suffered long spells of poor health in both childhood and later.</p>

		<p> One thing her mother insisted upon was that Ada get a high quality education.
	In those days, there were no places for girls in the United Kingdom's universities.
	However, girls from wealthy, aristocratic families could still be educated to a high level by private tutors. And this is how Ada was educated.
	Her mother wanted Ada to concentrate particularly hard on mathematics and science. She had two reasons for this:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>these were her own favorite subjects</li>
			<li>she was worried that insanity ran in Ada's father's damily and wanted her daughter to stay away from her father's interests, such as poetry </li>
		</ul>

		<p> Lady Byron also ensured Ada had tuition in music and French, since musical ability and the ability to read and make conversation in French were socially desirable.Her mother was very strict with Ada. In fact she seems to have been something of a tyrant, demanding that the young girl work very hard and punishing her with periods of isolation if she thought she had not worked hard enough. Lady Byron's desire was that her daughter would become a highly disciplined, serious person the opposite of her father.</p>

		<h2 id="math">Ada Lovelace: Mathmatician and Computer Scientist</h2>

		<p> It may seem odd to call someone born in 1815 a computer scientist, but that is what Ada Lovelace became.Her life changed forever on June 5, 1833, when the 17 year-old girl met Charles Babbage. This was not something many girls Ada's age could ever do, but as an aristocrat she enjoyed better opportunities than most.Babbage was Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge, a position once held by Isaac Newton and held more recently by Stephen Hawking.</p>

		<p> Babbage learned that both Lady Byron and her daughter were knowledgeable about mathematics and invited them to see a small-scale version of the calculating machine he was working on called the difference engine.</p>

		<p> Babbage had become fed up with people making mistakes in lengthy calculations, and his idea was to build an infallible steam-driven or hand-cranked calculating machine. Ada was completely captivated by the concept, but there was little she could do at the time to help Babbage with his work.</p>
	
		<p> However, she sent a message to Babbage requesting copies of the machine's blueprints, because she was determined to understand how it worked.</p>

		<h2 id="mach">Learning That You Can Talk to Machines</h2>

		</figure>
		</div>


    	<p> Ada and Lady Byron also arranged to visit factories where they could see steam driven machines at work and learn as much as they could about mechanical devices. These were highly unusual activities for an aristocratic woman and her daughter!</p>

		<p> An important part of Ada's education was to see the Jacquard loom in operation.
	The Jacquard loom was a machine that produced textiles with patterns woven into them. Joseph Marie Jacquard had invented it in 1801. The Jacquard loom was controlled by punch cards, with one card equal to one row of the textile being woven. If the card was punched, the loom thread would be raised. If the card was not punched, the loom thread would be left alone. In other words, the punch cards issued instructions to the machine They were a simple language, or putting it another way, machine code.</p>

		<h2 id="marr">More Math and also Marriage and Children</h2>

		<p>Ada continued her independent pursuit of mathematical knowledge. She became friends with one of the finest female mathematicians of her time, Mary Somerville, who discussed modern mathematics with Ada, set her higher level mathematics problems, and talked in detail about Charles Babbage's difference engine.</p>

		<p>In 1835, at the age of 19, Ada married William King, the Earl of Lovelace, with whom she would have three children between 1836 and 1839.</p>

		<p>In 1841 she began working on mathematics again, and was given advanced work by Professor Augustus De Morgan of University College London. She also continued to learn advanced mathematics through correspondence with Mary Somerville. All the time, she had kept Babbage's difference engine in mind.</p>

		<h2 id="notes">Ada Lovelace's Notes on the Analytical Engine</h2>

		<p>In 1842 Ada Lovelace became aware of a work in French called Sketch of Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine, by Luigi Federico Menabrea, an engineer.Menabrea had listened to lectures by Babbage and written them up in French. By this time, Babbage had moved on from the difference engine to a much higher level computer concept, the analytical engine.The analytical engine would be capable of much more sophisticated calculations than the original difference engine.</p>
	
		<p>Indeed, the analytical engine concept was completely groundbreaking, and a work of incredible genius on Babbage's part; it was the world's first programmable computer. In modern terms, the analytical engine would be described as Turing-complete. It featured an arithmetic logic portion, control flow by loops and conditional branching, and separate memory – and all of this to be built using mechanical parts and powered by hand-cranking or steam!</p>

		<p>Ada Lovelace got hold of Menabrea's work and translated it into English.
		Babbage read her translation and asked her why she had not written such a paper herself, because she was more than capable. Perhaps she could now add her own thoughts to Menabrea's work?</p>

		<p>Ada Lovelace responded by adding notes to her translation of Menabrea's work. Her notes were three times more extensive than the original work. When her English translation was published, most of the work published was actually her own.</p>

		<p>She also added algebraic workings to the notes for how an analytical engine could perform calculations. Babbage himself took on one of the trickiest calculations – Bernoulli Numbers – and sent it to Ada to include in her work, but she detected and corrected what Babbage himself described as 'a grave error' in his working. In her notes, she included the world's first published computer program, or algorithm – this was the Bernoulli number algorithm – and hence she is often cited as the world's first computer programmer. It would be fair to say, though, that Babbage contributed much of this section of her notes – precisely how much is the subject of academic debate.</p>

		<p>In her notes Ada Lovelace broke new ground in computing, when she realized something that nobody else had. She realized that an analytical engine could go beyond numbers. This was the first ever conception of a modern computer – not just a calculator – but a machine that could contribute to other areas of human endeavor, for example to compose music.</p>

		<p>Ada Lovelace had grasped that anything that could be converted into numbers, such as music, or the alphabet (language) or images, could then be manipulated by computer algorithms. An analytical engine had the potential to revolutionize the way the whole world worked, not just the world of mathematics.</p>

		<p>Ada's notes indicate that her mental processes had evolved further than her mother's strictly disciplined approach. She had become comfortable with a more visionary approach. Yes, it's true that her notes are full of mathematics, but she had freed her mind sufficiently to look beyond the equations and algorithms to other possibilities. Babbage himself described her as ‘an enchantress of numbers.</p>

		<p>However, this was not destined to be the brilliant dawn of a new science.
		Ada Lovelace became increasingly unwell after she wrote her notes and died young. Charles Babbage ran into financial problems, which meant that he never built a working computer.An important question to ask at this stage is: could one of Babbage's mechanical computers ever have worked in practice?</p>

		</div>

		<p>In 1991, Doron Swade, Curator of Computing at London's Science Museum, had a difference engine built using Babbage's design.</p>

		<p>It weighed 5 tons and worked perfectly. One or two small design errors had to be corrected, although it is likely that these were deliberate errors aimed at preventing a competitor or foreign government building an engine easily if they could steal the plans.</p>

		<h2 id="alan">Enter Alan Turing</h2>
		
		<p>About 90 years after Ada Lovelace wrote her notes, Alan Turing entered the field. Turing, of course, was a genius in his own right.</p>

		<p>As a young man he had read Ada Lovelace's notes, among many other papers he read. We know he disagreed with one of her conclusions - that artificial intelligence is not possible. She believed that computers could only ever follow instructions, and could never 'think'; independently. Turing demonstrated that she was wrong.</p>

		<p>Unfortunately, with no means of asking him the question, we cannot say to what extent Ada Lovelace's work actually influenced his concept of The Universal Turing Machine, the machine concept that began the modern age of computing.</p>

		<p>Certainly the mathematics involved in the development of the Universal Turing Machine is beyond anything done in Babbage and Lovelace's time. On the other hand, the concept of a machine that could be more than a calculator, to compose music, for example, began with Lovelace's notes.</p>

		<p>The codebreakers at Bletchley Park in the United Kingdom, where Turing worked during World War 2, built and used the Colossus series of computers – the world's first electronic computers. In doing so, they actually put Lovelace's visionary concept of a computer to work."</p>

		<p>Coded text from German messages was converted to numbers which could then undergo statistical analysis by the computer before being converted back into text that could be read and understood by humans.</p>

		<h2>The Mother of Modern Computing?</h2>

		<p>So, is it correct to describe Ada Lovelace as the mother of our modern concept of computing? If we're using language like mothers and fathers,I think we're on pretty safe ground to say that Ada Lovelace is the mother of modern computing, and Charles Babbage is the father.</p>

		<p>What we can't say for certain is:
		Did Ada and Charles's child die in infancy, so that Turing's computing breakthroughs represented an entirely new child?</p>

		<p>Did Ada and Charles's child live on in some kind of suspended animation until it was rediscovered, adopted and reared into adulthood by Alan Turing. We shall probably never know the answer.</p>

		<p>What we do know is that the Pentagon and US military's programmers named their own computing language Ada.</p>

		<h2 id="end">The End</h2>

		<p>Ada Lovelace died, probably of uterine cancer, at the age of 36 on November 27, 1852. Her health had deteriorated after she completed her notes on the analytical engine, and she had suffered a variety of illnesses. She had been in pain for several years, and was given opiates by her physicians to help her cope with it. She also drank considerable amounts of alcohol, affecting her moods in her later years.</p>

		<p>In the end, she forgave her father for abandoning her as a baby. She came to believe that her mother had deliberately tried to turn her against her father. Ada requested that she be buried beside Lord Byron at the Church of St. Mary Magdalene, Hucknall, Nottingham. Her grave can be seen there today.</p>

		<p>We’ll end with the words penned by Lord Byron at the beginning of one of his greatest works Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage soon after he left his wife and baby daughter forever.</p>

		<h2> Sketch of the Analytical Engine</h2>
		<h3>Invented by Charles Babbage</h3>
		<h4> By L.F. Menabrea  <a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/babbage/sketch.html" target="_blank">Source</a></h4>



		<p>Those labours which belong to the various branches of the mathematical sciences, although on first consideration they seem to be the exclusive province of intellect, may, nevertheless, be divided into two distinct sections; one of which may be called the mechanical, because it is subjected to precise and invariable laws, that are capable of being expressed by means of the operations of matter; while the other, demanding the intervention of reasoning, belongs more specially to the domain of the understanding. This admitted, we may propose to execute, by means of machinery, the mechanical branch of these labours, reserving for pure intellect that which depends on the reasoning faculties. Thus the rigid exactness of those laws which regulate numerical calculations must frequently have suggested the employment of material instruments, either for executing the whole of such calculations or for abridging them; and thence have arisen several inventions having this object in view, but which have in general but partially attained it. For instance, the much-admired machine of Pascal is now simply an object of curiosity, which, whilst it displays the powerful intellect of its inventor, is yet of little utility in itself. Its powers extended no further than the execution of the first four operations of arithmetic, and indeed were in reality confined to that of the first two, since multiplication and division were the result of a series of additions and subtractions. The chief drawback hitherto on most of such machines is, that they require the continual intervention of a human agent to regulate their movements, and thence arises a source of errors; so that, if their use has not become general for large numerical calculations, it is because they have not in fact resolved the double problem which the question presents, that of correctness in the results, united with economy of time.</p>

		<p>Struck with similar reflections, Mr. Babbage has devoted some years to the realization of a gigantic idea. He proposed to himself nothing less than the construction of a machine capable of executing not merely arithmetical calculations, but even all those of analysis, if their laws are known. The imagination is at first astounded at the idea of such an undertaking; but the more calm reflection we bestow on it, the less impossible does success appear, and it is felt that it may depend on the discovery of some principle so general, that, if applied to machinery, the latter may be capable of mechanically translating the operations which may be indicated to it by algebraical notation. The illustrious inventor having been kind enough to communicate to me some of his views on this subject during a visit he made at Turin, I have, with his approbation, thrown together the impressions they have left on my mind. But the reader must not expect to find a description of Mr. Babbage's engine; the comprehension of this would entail studies of much length; and I shall endeavour merely to give an insight into the end proposed, and to develop the principles on which its attainment depends.</p>

		<p>I must first premise that this engine is entirely different from that of which there is a notice in the ‘Treatise on the Economy of Machinery,’ by the same author. But as the latter gave rise to the idea of the engine in question, I consider it will be a useful preliminary briefly to recall what were Mr. Babbage's first essays, and also the circumstances in which they originated.</p>

		<p>It is well known that the French government, wishing to promote the extension of the decimal system, had ordered the construction of logarithmical and trigonometrical tables of enormous extent. M. de Prony, who had been entrusted with the direction of this undertaking, divided it into three sections, to each of which was appointed a special class of persons. In the first section the formulæ were so combined as to render them subservient to the purposes of numerical calculation; in the second, these same formulæ were calculated for values of the variable, selected at certain successive distances; and under the third section, comprising about eighty individuals, who were most of them only acquainted with the first two rules of arithmetic, the values which were intermediate to those calculated by the second section were interpolated by means of simple additions and subtractions.</p>

		<p>An undertaking similar to that just mentioned having been entered upon in England, Mr. Babbage conceived that the operations performed under the third section might be executed by a machine; and this idea he realized by means of mechanism, which has been in part put together, and to which the name Difference Engine is applicable, on account of the principle upon which its construction is founded. To give some notion of this, it will suffice to consider the series of whole square numbers, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, c. By subtracting each of these from the succeeding one, we obtain a new series, which we will name the Series of First Differences, consisting of the numbers 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, c. On subtracting from each of these the preceding one, we obtain the Second Differences, which are all constant and equal to 2. We may represent this succession of operations, and their results, in the following table.</p>

		<p>From the mode in which the last two columns B and C have been formed, it is easy to see, that if, for instance, we desire to pass from the number 5 to the succeeding one 7, we must add to the former the constant difference 2; similarly, if from the square number 9 we would pass to the following one 16, we must add to the former the difference 7, which difference is in other words the preceding difference 5, plus the constant difference 2; or again, which comes to the same thing, to obtain 16 we have only to add together the three numbers 2, 5, 9, placed obliquely in the direction ab. Similarly, we obtain the number 25 by summing up the three numbers placed in the oblique direction dc: commencing by the addition 2+7, we have the first difference 9 consecutively to 7; adding 16 to the 9 we have the square 25. We see then that the three numbers 2, 5, 9 being given, the whole series of successive square numbers, and that of their first differences likewise may be obtained by means of simple additions.</p>

		<p>Now, to conceive how these operations may be reproduced by a machine, suppose the latter to have three dials, designated as A, B, C, on each of which are traced, say a thousand divisions, by way of example, over which a needle shall pass. The two dials, C, B, shall have in addition a registering hammer, which is to give a number of strokes equal to that of the divisions indicated by the needle. For each stroke of the registering hammer of the dial C, the needle B shall advance one division; similarly, the needle A shall advance one division for every stroke of the registering hammer of the dial B. Such is the general disposition of the mechanism.</p>

		<p>This being understood, let us, at the beginning of the series of operations we wish to execute, place the needle C on the division 2, the needle B on the division 5, and the needle A on the division 9. Let us allow the hammer of the dial C to strike; it will strike twice, and at the same time the needle B will pass over two divisions. The latter will then indicate the number 7, which succeeds the number 5 in the column of first differences. If we now permit the hammer of the dial B to strike in its turn, it will strike seven times, during which the needle A will advance seven divisions; these added to the nine already marked by it will give the number 16, which is the square number consecutive to 9. If we now recommence these operations, beginning with the needle C, which is always to be left on the division 2, we shall perceive that by repeating them indefinitely, we may successively reproduce the series of whole square numbers by means of a very simple mechanism.</p>

		<p>The theorem on which is based the construction of the machine we have just been describing, is a particular case of the following more general theorem: that if in any polynomial whatever, the highest power of whose variable is m, this same variable be increased by equal degrees; the corresponding values of the polynomial then calculated, and the first, second, third, c. differences of these be taken (as for the preceding series of squares); the mth differences will all be equal to each other. So that, in order to reproduce the series of values of the polynomial by means of a machine analogous to the one above described, it is sufficient that there be (m+1) dials, having the mutual relations we have indicated. As the differences may be either positive or negative, the machine will have a contrivance for either advancing or retrograding each needle, according as the number to be algebraically added may have the sign plus or minus.</p>

		<p>If from a polynomial we pass to a series having an infinite number of terms, arranged according to the ascending powers of the variable, it would at first appear, that in order to apply the machine to the calculation of the function represented by such a series, the mechanism must include an infinite number of dials, which would in fact render the thing impossible. But in many cases the difficulty will disappear, if we observe that for a great number of functions the series which represent them may be rendered convergent; so that, according to the degree of approximation desired, we may limit ourselves to the calculation of a certain number of terms of the series, neglecting the rest. By this method the question is reduced to the primitive case of a finite polynomial. It is thus that we can calculate the succession of the logarithms of numbers. But since, in this particular instance, the terms which had been originally neglected receive increments in a ratio so continually increasing for equal increments of the variable, that the degree of approximation required would ultimately be affected, it is necessary, at certain intervals, to calculate the value of the function by different methods, and then respectively to use the results thus obtained, as data whence to deduce, by means of the machine, the other intermediate values. We see that the machine here performs the office of the third section of calculators mentioned in describing the tables computed by order of the French government, and that the end originally proposed is thus fulfilled by it.</p>

		<p>Such is the nature of the first machine which Mr. Babbage conceived. We see that its use is confined to cases where the numbers required are such as can be obtained by means of simple additions or subtractions; that the machine is, so to speak, merely the expression of one particular theorem of analysis; and that, in short, its operations cannot be extended so as to embrace the solution of an infinity of other questions included within the domain of mathematical analysis. It was while contemplating the vast field which yet remained to be traversed, that Mr. Babbage, renouncing his original essays, conceived the plan of another system of mechanism whose operations should themselves possess all the generality of algebraical notation, and which, on this account, he denominates the Analytical Engine.</p>

		<p>Having now explained the state of the question, it is time for me to develop the principle on which is based the construction of this latter machine. When analysis is employed for the solution of any problem, there are usually two classes of operations to execute: first, the numerical calculation of the various coefficients; and secondly, their distribution in relation to the quantities affected by them. If, for example, we have to obtain the product of two binomials (a+bx) (m+nx), the result will be represented by am + (an + bm) x + bnx2, in which expression we must first calculate am, an, bm, bn; then take the sum of an + bm; and lastly, respectively distribute the coefficients thus obtained amongst the powers of the variable. In order to reproduce these operations by means of a machine, the latter must therefore possess two distinct sets of powers: first, that of executing numerical calculations; secondly, that of rightly distributing the values so obtained.</p>

		<p>But if human intervention were necessary for directing each of these partial operations, nothing would be gained under the heads of correctness and economy of time; the machine must therefore have the additional requisite of executing by itself all the successive operations required for the solution of a problem proposed to it, when once the primitive numerical data for this same problem have been introduced. Therefore, since, from the moment that the nature of the calculation to be executed or of the problem to be resolved have been indicated to it, the machine is, by its own intrinsic power, of itself to go through all the intermediate operations which lead to the proposed result, it must exclude all methods of trial and guess-work, and can only admit the direct processes of calculation.</p>

		<p>It is necessarily thus; for the machine is not a thinking being, but simply an automaton which acts according to the laws imposed upon it. This being fundamental, one of the earliest researches its author had to undertake, was that of finding means for effecting the division of one number by another without using the method of guessing indicated by the usual rules of arithmetic. The difficulties of effecting this combination were far from being among the least; but upon it depended the success of every other. Under the impossibility of my here explaining the process through which this end is attained, we must limit ourselves to admitting that the first four operations of arithmetic, that is addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, can be performed in a direct manner through the intervention of the machine. This granted, the machine is thence capable of performing every species of numerical calculation, for all such calculations ultimately resolve themselves into the four operations we have just named. To conceive how the machine can now go through its functions according to the laws laid down, we will begin by giving an idea of the manner in which it materially represents numbers.</p>
